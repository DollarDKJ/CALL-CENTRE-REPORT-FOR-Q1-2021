# CALL-CENTRE-REPORT-FOR-Q1-2021

Call Center Analysis

As part of my ongoing training in the #WomenTechstersBootcampCohort2.6, I worked on the call center dataset to provide some insights on how the center is doing.

The dataset was obtained from www.kaggle.com. They are raw dataset for 2021 Q1 for a call center. It contains 5000 call records

The call center dataset was cleaned up in Power Query. It contained some data quality issues like incorrect datatype, null values, short words etc. it was uploaded into Power BI after the cleanup.

It is natural to see null values in a dataset and they are usually treated as insignificant values to be deleted. However, the null values contained in this dataset play an important role because they represent calls that were either not answered or not resolved.

The key insights are:
1.	The total number of calls received for the Q1 of 2021 was 5000.
2.	The number of resolved and answered calls by the call center agents were higher than the unresolved and unanswered calls. 
3.	The satisfaction rating was not impressive as customers who are neutral about their experiences were higher than the satisfied and very satisfied customers.
4.	For the 3 months analyzed, there was a decline in the number of calls to the call center. 1772 was recorded in January.1616 in February and finally 1612 in March. This could suggest that customers do not make calls to the call center because they feel that their issues will not be handled comprehensively.
